      "message": "Thinking back to the slides I used months ago, and looking at the NIC batch processing sequence of HLHLHLHLHLHL HHHHH.... , I think that two parallel queues to sort between the H and L frames, and a queue management that serves the H first, then serves the L queue until the next batch arrives. The H frames would be served again when the next burst arrives, but there has to be a minimum service time for the L queue.  So, we see a sequence something like this:  HHHHHHHHH LLLL HHHHHHHHH LLLL",
