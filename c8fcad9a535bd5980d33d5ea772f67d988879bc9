      "message": "If you mean, integrate this into the flow classification interface of ovs (e.g. ofctl), then I think that would be the ideal interface.  However, when I tried to do that, I realised that it would be really tricky to implement. I believe we would need to have a seperate flow classification entity that classifies much earlier in the pipeline and also more lightweight as we dont want to spend a load of cycles classifying a low priority packet before we even look at a high priority packet. However, if you can think of a way to do this, I would love to hear your suggestion as this is the point of writing all this down to elicit this type of feedback.",
