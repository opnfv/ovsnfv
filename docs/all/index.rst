Open vSwitch for NFV
====================
Welcome to OVSNFV's documentation !

.. _OVSNFV: https://wiki.opnfv.org/open_vswitch_for_nfv
.. _REPO: https://opnfv.org/gerrit/ovsnfv

OVSNFV_ is an OPNFV collaborative development project.

The OVSNFV project proposes:

* To modify the OPNFV build to include a deployment option for the
  software-accelerated userspace Open vSwitch build. This change will
  significantly improve the performance of the NFVI for network I/O.
* Future work to encompass collaborative development within the Open
  vSwitch project to improve the performance of the software-accelerated
  userspace Open vSwitch and increasing its suitability for Telco NFV
  deployments.
