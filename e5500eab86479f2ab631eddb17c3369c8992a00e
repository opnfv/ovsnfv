      "message": "-n works to see if a variable is set to a null string and only if string is quoted. In this patch set, the variable might not exist which is not the same thing.\nThe following snippet is from http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/comparison-ops.html#FTN.AEN3669\n---------\n-n\nstring is not null.\n\nCaution\t\nThe -n test requires that the string be quoted within the test brackets. Using an unquoted string with ! -z, or even just the unquoted string alone within test brackets (see Example 7-6) normally works, however, this is an unsafe practice. Always quote a tested string. [1]\n-------\n\n-n tests if the string is not null it doesn\u0027t test that the variable exists and I wanted a check that will work in both cases.\nThe best way probably is something like [ \"zz$testme\" \u003d\u003d \"zz\" ]\nPreferably, the arguments to the scripts need to be regularized.\n\nI would rather tackle this sort of change with a later patch set once we know that RPMs are being built in the daily builds, placed int he artifactory and are OK.",
